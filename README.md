The Contact Management Project is a simple desktop application built using Python, Tkinter, SQLite, NumPy, and Pandas. The application allows users to manage their contacts efficiently with the following key features:

KEY FEATURES:-
User Authentication:

A login page that requires users to enter a username and password to access the application. This adds a layer of security to the contact management system.

DATA STORAGES:-

Contacts are stored in a SQLite database, allowing for persistent data storage and retrieval.
User Interface:

The application features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their contacts.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:-

Python: The programming language used to build the application.
Tkinter: A standard GUI toolkit for Python, used to create the graphical user interface.
SQLite: A lightweight database engine used for storing contact information.
NumPy: A library for numerical operations, used for analyzing phone number lengths.
Pandas: A data manipulation library, used for handling and displaying contact data in a structured format.
